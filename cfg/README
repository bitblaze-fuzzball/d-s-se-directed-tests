			    =======================

* programname-cksum1-cksum2.stat.cfg

* programname-cksum1-cksum2.dyn.cfg

programname is the name of the binary analyzed

cksum1 are the first 6 characters of the md5 of the program traces

cksum2 are the first 6 characters of the md5 of the .cfg file

.dyn stands for CFGs constructed entirely dynamically

.stat stands for CFGs constructed dynamically and the augmented statically
